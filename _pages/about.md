I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://grad.illinois.edu/), where I am advised by [Dr. Arindam Banerjee](https://arindam.cs.illinois.edu/). I previously completed my master’s at UIUC, collaborating with [Dr. Arindam Banerjee](https://arindam.cs.illinois.edu/) at UIUC, as well as with [Dr. Sanmi Koyejo](https://cs.stanford.edu/~sanmi/) and [Berivan Isik](https://sites.google.com/view/berivanisik) at Stanford University.

Before joining UIUC, I served as a research assistant under [Prof. Jonathan Scarlett](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~scarlett/) at the National University of Singapore, where I worked on Multi-Armed Bandits. I also spent a year at Samsung’s AI R&D Lab in South Korea, focusing on speech processing and language models.

I completed my undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering from IIT Kanpur, where I had the opportunity to work with [Dr. Himanshu Tyagi](https://ece.iisc.ac.in/~htyagi/) at IISc, [Dr. Vipul Arora](https://vipular.github.io/) at IIT Kanpur, and Dr. Minseok Kwon at Samsung Electronics.

My current research interests lie in machine learning algorithms and theory, with a focus on federated learning algorithms, stochastic optimization for overparametrized models, and sampling algorithms.
