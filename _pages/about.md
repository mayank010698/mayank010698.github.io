Hi! I am a master's in Computer Science student at the [University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign](https://grad.illinois.edu/). I am advised by  [Dr. Arindam Banerjee](https://arindam.cs.illinois.edu/). Currently, I am working on tackling distribution shifts in ML models.

Before joining UIUC, I was a research assistant with [Prof. Jonathan Scarlett](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~scarlett/) at NUS. Previously, I spent a wonderful year working in the AI R&D Lab at Samsung Research and Development Headquarters in South Korea. 

I completed my undergrad from IIT Kanpur in Electrical Engineering. I worked with [Dr. Himanshu Tyagi](https://ece.iisc.ac.in/~htyagi/) at IISC, [Dr.Vipul Arora](https://vipular.github.io/) at IITK, and Dr. Minseok Kwon at Samsung Electronics during my undergraduate years.
