title:  Max-Quantile Grouped Infinite-Arm Bandits
date: 2015-10-01
description: In recommendation systems, one may wish to know which among several populations has the highest median click-through rate, while displaying as few total recommendations as possible. In this paper, we develop an algorithm to identify the infinite-arm group whose reservoir distribution has the highest median.
